# ICS - IGUANA CLUSTER SYSTEM - V.3.5

You can install the Iguana in two ways:

1. Run the command below on your Ubuntu 21.04 (tested) to execute the installation script; or

```
apt install curl -y && curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iguana-hpc-usp/ICS/master/install.sh | bash -s --
```

2. Download the ready-to-use virtual machine and just import it into VirtualBox.

If using the VM, do not forget to correctly configure the network adapter for bridge mode.

After installation, see your IP host address and access it in the browser on port 8000, and that's it!

See an example:


```
http://HOST_IP:8000
```
